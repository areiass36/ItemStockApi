# Item Stock Api

This is a project I developed in my java bootcamp. It´s the first time I ever created a RESTful API (And it was really fun doing it), since its very simple I don´t think it needs any explanation.

Its a simple CRUD, only has two tables, item and person, which relate to which other in order to keep track of all added items in stock.

In the bootcamp they used h2 as database, but since it only stores data in main memory I changed to mysql, which I´m used to work with. 

I´d like to also point that I got really freak out when hibernate created the entire database for me as well (I used to spend hour trying to create a good crud set of classes and hibernate does is very quickly) ITS THE COOLEST!
